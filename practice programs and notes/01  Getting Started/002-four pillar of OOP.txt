There are four pillars in OOP.
1. encapsulation - we group related variables, and functions that operate on them into objects |or| wrapping up data into a single unit.
2. abstraction   - Abstraction is the concept of object-Oriented Programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information. |or| hide the details and show the essentials
3. inheritance   - INheritance is a mechanism that allows you to eliminate redundant code
4. polymorphism  - Polymorphism is a technique that allows you to get rid of long if and else or switch and case statements

before Object Oriented Programming , we had procedural programming language.
that divide a program into a set of functions.


Benifits of OOP
Encapsulation - Reduce complexity + increase reusability
Abstraction   - Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes
Inheritance   - Eliminate redundant code
Polymorphism  - Refactor ugly switch/case statements
